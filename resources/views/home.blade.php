    <p>Hello to you!</p>
    <p>If you missclicked we do still offer you a slice of cake! Just don’t ask what’s in it. We are not exactly sure. The lady who gave it to us seemed nice.</p>
    <p>To talk about what we have to offer here at Moogle Mafia, well.. if Brann Farlig could stop burning every thingamabob we had everywhere we could have offered more, but enough on that. Just a friendly tip, if you see a tiny ember, just run. Don’t look at it, just run.</p>
    <p>Our Free Company is rank 8, with all the fuzz that comes with that. We do also have Airships and Submarines Brann and a few others are building in our workshop, while I stand nervously in a corner looking for embers.</p>
    <p>The house is small, but it is our home. We are saving up money every day to afford a large estate when the new expansion comes out. Our gardener is running around all day watering every plant we have and some mushrooms he tends to keep for himself. Don’t ask. Just don’t go down in the basement after 3am.</p>
    <p>Many of our members choose to pitch in, but it is not a requirement, but together we are stronger right? Like the gardener after 3 of those mushrooms. We have a stone foundation and bolted doors. Don’t worry! Just don’t note the advice further up in the text.</p>
    <p>If you are still here reading this, well good! I am going to take it over to a more serious note.</p>
    <p>Our current main focus is to mentor new and returning players to ffxiv and give them a home to learn and grow.</p>
    <p>The Free Company is ofc open to veteran members alike as we do have a long-term plan that includes everyone, old and new.</p>
    <p>There will be casual raiding teams with their own Raid leaders. We will also have Mentor raids, were we will go into a raid and spend a good amount of time on each boss explaining all mechanics properly so every player understands and can keep on building onto more challenging content. This also include Trials and all other endgame content.</p>
    <p>Plans will ofc evolve over time when we keep growing. The engame for us is making a home for every type of player in ffxiv and make them feel welcome and as if they are a part of a huge family, because that is what we strive to be!</p>
    <p>There will also be a steady stream of events each month for everyone! No one gets excluded in our Free Company!</p>
    <p>We offer reoccurring events as Legacy Raid/trial runs, Chocobo races, Treasure hunts and more!</p>
    <p>Me and Brann has had this dream for a good amount of time now and we hope you want to be a part of it!</p>
    <p>Moogle Mafia has also made its own community HuB to support a wide specter of games! </p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a good ffxiv experience! Take care!</p>
