    <p'>DISCLAIMER: Free Company rules will inevitably change over time. Members are expected to accept and adhere to new rules regardless of their personal opinions.

    <dl>
        <dt>Rule #1</dt>
        <dd>Respect others. Treat all other players with dignity and respect. 
            Be respectful of other members of the FC, their abilities, their contributions, and any extra duties they perform to keep the FC running.</dd>
        <dt>Rule #2</dt>
        <dd>We all play to have fun. Don't ruin it for other people. It Is up to each individual to approach the game as they see fit.</dd>
        <dt>Rule #3</dt>
        <dd>You are part of a Free Company. We succeed as a group, not as individuals. Self-centred and self-absorbed attitudes are not helpful.</dd>

            As adults, members are expected to either try to resolve disagreements with other players civilly and privately.
            Failing that, try to work around it. Approach an Officer for assistance if you have exhausted all other options.</dd>
        <dt>Rule #5</dt>
        <dd>Breaches of the Code of Conduct will result in disciplinary action from the Free Company Leadership
             appropriate to the player's rank and the nature of the breach. </dd>
        <dt>Rule #6</dt>
        <dd>We are a 18+ age FC.</dd>
        <dt>Rule #7</dt>
        <dd>We do also follow Square enix set of rules for ffxiv. Violation of this will result with a ban and reported to Square enix.</dd>
